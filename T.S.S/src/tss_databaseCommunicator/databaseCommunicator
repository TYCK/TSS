database communicator

All information which will be taken in, will be in the format of JSON format. This will take all the information into a class of 

JSONObject, which is then easier to parse using the JSONParser.


Therefore, the most important thing to code is the function which will be taking the information from the database. 


Functions to be coded : 
____________________________________________________________________________

-GET-
getStudent()
getCourse()

-GET-&-POST-
editStudent()

-POST-
registerCourses()

All of these methods will actually draw on information from the database.
